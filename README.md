# Topielski Turn Based System
A turn-based battle system created by following [Jon Topielski's design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifXGvlAn0bY&t=11s).

## What I learnt
- Autoload singletons
- Control nodes and building basic UI
- Awaiting for signals and animations to finish before executing more code (something I really wanted to learn)
- Resources

## Extra
Thhe video tutorial connected signals via the editor but I opted to do it through code instead.
